# Django REST Framework Starter Project

This project kicks things off with the official Django REST Framework (DRF) quickstart tutorial. It's a simple, clean foundation for building out a more robust API, providing basic endpoints for user and group management.

The goal is to evolve this simple setup into a full-featured application by adding a dedicated service layer, background tasks with Celery, and comprehensive test coverage.
